Description: It fits a robust linear quantile regression model using a new
    family of zero-quantile distributions for the error term. Missing values and censored observations can be handled as well. This family of
    distribution includes skewed versions of the Normal, Student's t, Laplace, Slash
    and Contaminated Normal distribution. It also performs logistic quantile regression for bounded responses
    as shown in Galarza et.al.(2020) <doi:10.1007/s13571-020-00231-0>. It provides estimates and full inference.
    It also provides envelopes plots for assessing the fit and confidences bands
    when several quantiles are provided simultaneously.
